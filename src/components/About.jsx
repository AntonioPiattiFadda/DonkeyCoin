            <p>
              Donky is there to protect the other <br /> memes especially $PEPE
              and $BOME in <br /> their race to be the first memecoin to <br />
              reach $1 limit.
            </p>
            <p>
              Donky will do anything to protect the <br /> princes ($Pepe,$Bome)
              from all the dogs <br /> and cats and other memes. But who <br />
              knows, maybe he will be the lucky one in <br /> the end to be the
              first memecoin to cross <br /> the $1 limit, lol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Donky is here to make the memecoins <br /> competition even more
              attractive and <br />
              entertaining. $Donky is a coin for people <br /> who love the 80s
              and 90s and have <br /> wonderful memories of that timeâ€¦
